Those who seek to learn more about you—your weaknesses, your origins, your purpose—find themselves stymied by your disguise.

This allows you to change appearances between your two personalities as often as you wish, using one to hide the other or serve as convenient camouflage. However, should someone realize the connection between your persona and your true self, your deception might lose its effectiveness."

For the person behind the persona, the one who truly strives to be faceless, consider a distinct set of faceless characteristics.
